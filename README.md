# Multiple-Sensors-Mesurement

The goal of this box is to store sensors data into an SD card to analyze a mechanism behavior. (a scooter for example)

As mentioned above, the box regroups sensors :

- Current sensor
- DC sensor
- IMU (MPU6050)
- SD card module (GT126)
- Tachymeter

Then you could imagine the case of a system composed of a DC motor, with this box you will be able to get all the information concerning the system.
This could help you to compare make graphs and compare the experimental data to simulation. 


The box is portable, a band can be attached around the box. All the details concerning the design of the box are available in the Design folder.
